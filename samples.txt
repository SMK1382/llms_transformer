I see the sun.
You see the moon.
He looks happy.
She feels sad.
We walk home.
They run fast.
It looks small.
This tree is big.
That flower is nice.
My dog runs.
Your cat sleeps.
His bird sings.
Her voice smiles.
Our world shines.
Their time ends.
One man dreams.
Two women work.
Three friends play.
The child laughs.
A hand waves.
The night falls.
The day wakes.
The sky glows.
A star twinkles.
The road bends.
The house stands.
The city sleeps.
The fire burns.
The water flows.
The earth turns.
The air moves.
The bird flies.
The dog barks.
The cat purrs.
The fish swims.
The fruit falls.
The bread smells.
The food warms.
The story grows.
The song ends.
The word stays.
The voice breaks.
The light fades.
The dark comes.
The heart beats.
The mind thinks.
The smile shines.
The dream calls.
The love lives.
The life flows.
I go far.
You come near.
He runs fast.
She walks slow.
We sit here.
They stand there.
It looks new.
This road ends.
That home waits.
My time flies.
Your time stays.
His eyes shine.
Her heart breaks.
Our love grows.
Their smile fades.
One life ends.
Two lives meet.
Three lives join.
The fire warms.
The cold bites.
The warm light glows.
The dark night falls.
The happy child laughs.
The sad friend cries.
The good man helps.
The bad day hurts.
The big tree stands.
The small bird sings.
The long road waits.
The short time ends.
The fast car goes.
The slow walk soothes.
The old house stays.
The new city rises.
The near home calls.
The far world shines.
I make bread.
You take fruit.
He gives love.
She finds peace.
We lose time.
They live well.
I die slow.
You play song.
He works long.
She thinks deep.
We know truth.
They feel joy.
I need rest.
We dream again.
